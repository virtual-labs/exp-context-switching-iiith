        "d": "To manage hardware resources"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "is incorrect because in the kernel mode, the operating system does not execute user-level applications.",
        "b": "is incorrect because in the kernel mode, the operating system does not diplays user instructions.",
        "c": "is correct because in the kernel mode, the operating system manages system-level tasks such as memory management, device drivers, and interrupt handling. For example, it handles hardware interrupts generated by devices like disk drives or network cards",
        "d": "is incorrect because in the kernel mode, the operating system does not manage hardware resources."

        "b": "Stack pointer (SP)",
        "c": "General-purpose registers",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "is incorrect. During a context switch, the CPU typically saves and restores the program counter (PC).",
        "b": "is incorrect. During a context switch, the CPU typically saves and restores the Stack pointer.",
        "c": "is incorrect. During a context switch, the CPU typically saves and restores the general-purpose registers.",
        "d": "is correct. During a context switch, the CPU typically saves and restores the program counter (PC), stack pointer (SP), and general-purpose registers. Cache memory is not saved and restored because it is part of the CPU's internal architecture and not directly related to the process state."

        "a": "is incorrect because a timer interrupt does not synchronize processes.",
        "b": "is correct because a timer interrupt is used to enforce time-sharing among multiple processes in a multitasking operating system. When a timer interrupt occurs, the system can perform a context switch to allow another process to execute, ensuring fair CPU time allocation.",
